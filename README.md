## Open Standards We Support 🌐

Our founder contributes to the open-source AI community through **[agentpolicy.org](https://agentpolicy.org)** - an open standard protocol that defines how websites can control AI agent access and interaction with their content. Think of it as "robots.txt for the agentic web."

🔗 [View the Agent Policy Protocol Specification](https://github.com/agent-policy-protocol/spec)

As AI agents become more prevalent, standards like this ensure responsible and controlled agent behavior across the web, enabling website owners to define clear policies for how AI systems can interact with their content.
